```{r setup, include=F}
library(tidyverse)
library(treemap)

```

## Create

- You need a web browser to display htmlwidgets (which rely on HTML, JS, CSS), so you can use Rmarkdown to create [Presentations with ioslides](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/ioslides_presentation_format.html).

- Put the rendered `htmlwidgets_save.html` (and `rendered htmlwidgets_save.html`) in a new `docs/` folder, [turn on Github Pages using docs as Source in your repository's Settings](https://github.com/blog/2233-publish-your-project-documentation-with-github-pages) (requires admin privileges), and you'll be able to publicly view it at https://mhepner90.github.io/RVC/htmlwidget_save.html.

```{r trait visualization}
trait_matrix = read_csv('functional_diversity/species_trait_matrix_316_spp.csv')
trait_matrix_treemap = trait_matrix %>%
  select(Common_name, Maxlength, Trophic_level, Trophic_group, Water_column,Diel_activity,Substrate_type,Complexity, Gregariousness) %>% 
  group_by(Maxlength,
           Trophic_level,
           Trophic_group,
           Water_column,
           Diel_activity,
           Substrate_type,
           Complexity,
           Gregariousness) %>%
  summarise(n = n())%>% 
  ungroup() %>%
  as.data.frame()

treemap2 = 
  d3tree2(
    treemap(
      dtf = trait_matrix_treemap,
      index = c("Trophic_group", "Diel_activity", "Substrate_type", "Trophic_level", "Water_column","Maxlength","Complexity","Gregariousness"),
      vSize = "n", 
      vColor = "Trophic_group",
      type = "index",
      draw = F # turn off ghastly intermediate box plot
      ),
    rootname = "Species Traits")
```

## Interactive

```{r}
treemap2
```



## Static

- CSS font styles might clash between standalone html and embedded in presentation, which is fixable with some work

```{r htmlwidget to png}
# additional libraries
library(htmlwidgets)
library(webshot)

# paths
htm = './htmlwidget_treemap2.html'
png = './htmlwidget_treemap2.png'

# save widget as html
saveWidget(treemap2, htm)

# save widget as png
webshot(htm, png)
```

- You might need to crop and resize image in image editor (eg Preview on Mac) to fit on slide
